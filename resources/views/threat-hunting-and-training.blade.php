            <h2>Proactive Detection and Mitigation</h2>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, making continuous training essential for security teams. Our
                threat hunting training program is designed to equip analysts with the skills and tools needed to
                proactively detect and mitigate threats within their environments. This program covers a broad range of
                topics, from foundational threat hunting methodologies to advanced techniques in data analysis.
                Participants will gain hands-on experience working with enriched logs and learning how to extract
                actionable insights from real-world data.
            </p>
            <h2>Comprehensive Curriculum</h2>
            <p>
                The training curriculum includes methods for analyzing DNS, DHCP, NetFlow, syslog, and other critical
                data sources, ensuring that participants understand how to identify anomalies across different layers of
                the network. Additionally, we provide exclusive insights into best practices, tools, and strategies used
                by top security professionals for conducting custom investigations. Through interactive labs and
                deep-dive sessions, participants will learn how to think like threat hunters, interpret complex data
                sets, and uncover hidden cyber threats.
            </p>
            <h2>Skill-Building for All Levels</h2>
            <p>
                The training is structured to accommodate different skill levels, pairing analysts with coders for tasks
                such as Python scripting to enhance automation capabilities. This ensures that both technical and
                non-technical personnel can effectively contribute to the organization's security operations. By the end
                of the program, participants will be well-equipped to identify and respond to threats with greater
                accuracy and efficiency, strengthening their organization’s overall security posture.
